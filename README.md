# Multi-task sparse modelling to uncover the plant genome-metabolome interface

Poster presented at the International Plant Systems Biology 2018 conference, in Roscoff, France

This is yet another application of the GFLASSO to determine associations across omics datasets, using the `gflasso` package under development. This simple example shows how one can quickly recover the most salient quantitative trait loci (QTL) underlying multiple secondary metabolites mapped by [Gong, L. *et al*. (2013)](http://www.pnas.org/content/110/50/20320) in a bi-parental rice population. You can install the `gflasso` package using `devtools::install_github('monogenea/gflasso')`.
